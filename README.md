This is a Chrome Plugin that saves an HTML file that captures the current 
look of any webpage you are viewing.

The chrome extension strips out all <script> tags from the code in order to 
remove any "dynamic elements" from the page. In theory, this should save the webpage 
in exactly the form you are seeing it when you choose to "yrWebSnap" the page.
